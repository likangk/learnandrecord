Experts Say to Do This When You Feel That "Life Is Too Hard"



Best Life (Magazine)

FEBRUARY 28, 2019



No matter how hard you try to avoid them, you can't stop really bad days from happening. Maybe you lost your job. Maybe you had a terrible breakup with someone you considered "the one." Maybe you were blindsided by the loss of a loved one. The fact is, we all face times in our lives when we feel the coldest depths of despair, when the only thing we feel like doing is going somewhere quiet, staring at the ceiling, and crying. These are the moments when life feels way too hard.



When you've fallen into those depths, it's terribly difficult to know what to do. While there are a host of resources and tools online created to help you deal with especially tough moments, the one thing that you can do that is the most helpful may surprise you.



According to the experts we spoke to, the one thing that will make you feel better when you feel that life is just too hard is to simply sit with that feeling—to fully embrace it and recognize it, and not try to avoid or erase those feelings of pain you're experiencing. You should also practice radical honesty with yourself and your feelings in the moment, says psychotherapist Christine Scott-Hudson.



"You might want to practice writing about how you feel in a private journal," she advises. "Do not worry about grammar or spelling, but just free write for 20 minutes, never taking your pen off of the page. Write to the center of what hurts, write it all down. Then, put it away. Practice some good self-care. Return to your feelings later by reading what you put onto the page. Listen to yourself. Feel what you feel."



No matter how tough the practice may be, Lee Chaix McDonough, a clinical social worker and psychotherapist, recommends enlisting the help of one simple breathing and meditation exercise.



"To reconnect to the here and now, try the '5-4-3-2-1 exercise,'" says McDonough. "Begin by taking a few slow, deep breaths. Then, notice five things you can see, four things you can hear, three things you can feel, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. By focusing on your senses, you ground yourself in the present moment and reconnect to the here and now."



As you can imagine, there are also things you shouldn't do in those moments. According to life coach and anxiety specialist Vikki Louise, some of your everyday coping mechanisms—like downing a few drinks at the bar, or scrolling through social media to distract yourself from stressful responsibilities—will not help you when life gets truly tough.



"Allowing and accepting the human experience, bad days and all, may not sound exciting or dreamy, but it is truly necessary," says Louise. "One of the tricks I tell my clients is to say each year you will have 100 challenging days. That is part of the human experience. This means when they are feeling bad, they can allow it, knowing that it is one less bad day for them to face later in the year."



Finally, it's important to remember that even bad days can provide clarity and give your life meaning. Did that relationship that just ended really mean more to you than you previously thought?



According to McDonough, the answer will help you recognize the things that are actually important in your life. If you weren't already aware of how important that person was to you, now you are.



In short: only through pain can truly know how to be grateful for what you already have. And when you're ready to start taking steps to restore yourself, be sure to read the 17 Things Happy People Do Every Morning.



1. They limit news consumption.

2. They cut back on social media time.

3. They hang out with their pet(s).

4. They head outside.

5. They get frisky.

6. They hug their partner.

7. They drink coffee.

8. And work out while the coffee's brewing.

9. They laugh.

10. They plan their good deeds.

11. They meditate.

12. They practice positive self talk.

13. They set goals.

14. They wake up early.

15. They eat a healthy breakfast.

16. They spend time with friends and family.

17. They practice being thankful.

**专家说当你感觉“生活太难”的时候应该做这些**

**最好的生活（杂志）**

**2月 28,2019**

无论多努力去尝试避免~~他们~~，你都无法~~停止~~`阻止`真正的坏事发生。或许你失去了工作。或许你和你认为是命中注定的那位~~经历了糟糕的~~分手。又或许你因为失去挚爱之人而感到~~心痛~~`不知所措`。事实是，我们都在生活中面临过感到最寒冷的绝望深处的时刻，
那时我们唯一想做的就是去一个安静的地方，盯着天花板，然后哭泣。这是感到生活太艰难的的一些~~瞬间~~`时刻`。

当你落入这些绝望的时候，很难知道应该做些什么。 ~~然而~~`虽然`~~这里有一些线上创造~~`网上有大量`的资源和工具可以帮助你应对这些尤其困难的时刻，`但`其中你能做的最有用的一件事可能会让你感到惊讶。

根据我们~~所一起讨论过~~`采访过`的专家所说，有一件事能够让你在感到人生太难的时候心情变好，简单地~~坐下与那个感觉共存~~`接受这种感觉`，去~~充分~~`完全`地拥抱它和认知它。不要试图去躲避或
者消除那些你正感受到的痛苦。在此刻，你~~当然也需要练习你自己与你的感受理性地
诚实~~`还应该对自己和你此刻的感受保持彻底的诚实`。心理治疗师Christine Scott-Hudson如是说道。

她建议： “你可能想要在一本~~私密的杂志~~`个人日记`中练习写下你的感受”。“不要担心语法或者拼写，就自由地笔不离纸地写20分钟”。写到~~让你受伤的中心~~`受伤深处`，全都写下来，然后把它放在一边。练习一些好的自我~~照顾~~`护理`。
~~然后~~`稍后`通过阅读你在纸上写下的文字回到你的感受。倾听自己，感受你所感受到的。

无论这个练习可能有多难，Lee chaix McDonough，一位临床社会工作者以及心理治疗师建议~~列举~~`进行`一个简单的呼吸和冥想练习~~的好处~~。

尝试“5-4-3-2-1训练”来重新连接现在，Mcdonough说。 “一开始做一些慢的深呼吸。然后注意五个你们能看到的东西，四个你能听到的东西，三个你够感觉到的东西，二个你可以闻到的东西，以及一个你能够尝到的东西。
通过专注于你的感官，你让自己~~在此刻沉了下来~~`立足当下`并重连~~过去和~~现在”

正如你能够想象到的，在那些时刻也有一些不能做的事。 根据生活教练和焦虑专家Vikki Louise 所说：一些你~~每天所重复的行为~~`日常应对机制`，例如在酒吧喝一点饮料或者翻阅社交媒体来~~使你从压力的责任中抽离出来~~`分散对压力的注意力`，并不会
在你遇到真正的人生艰难的时候有所帮助。

“允许并接受人类的经历，坏日子~~和所有~~`等等`，可能听起来并不令人激动和向往，但是这真的很有必要” Louise说道。“我告诉客户的一个小技巧是去说每年你都会有100个挑战天，这是人的经历的一部分。这意味着当他们感到糟糕的时候
，他们可以~~允许~~`接受`它，知道今年往后的的日子里所要面对的坏日子少了一天”。

最后，重要的是要记住即使是坏日子也能够为你的生活带来清晰和意义。难道你刚刚结束的关系真的对你来说比你之前所想的意味着更多吗？

根据McDonough所说，这个回答将能帮助你认识到真正对你生活重要的事。如果你之前没有已经认识到那个人对你有多重要，现在你知道了。

简短的说：只有通过痛苦才能知道如何对已经拥有的心存感激。并且当你准备去开始着手恢复自己的的时候，记得读17件快乐人士每天早晨都做的事。
